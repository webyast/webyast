== System Actions


GET /graphs/<component>?<checklimits>=true

  Get the graph description which data has to be shown and how the data has to be shown in
  the graphs.

  <b>component</b>: component like CPU, memory,... (optional)

  <b>checklimits</b>: checking if a defined limit has been reached for all or only one component (optional)

  CURL Example: 

  curl -u user http://localhost:4984/graphs.xml

  curl -u user http://localhost:4984/graphs.xml?checklimits=true

  curl -u user http://localhost:4984/graphs/Memory.xml

  curl -u user http://localhost:4984/graphs/Memory.xml?checklimits=true

XmlResult: graphs

GET /metrics

  Getting the information which data is available (CPU, Network,..). This call does not return the current values
  of e.G. free Memory.

  CURL Example: curl -u user http://localhost:4984/metrics.xml

XmlResult: metrics

GET /metrics/<metrics-id>?<start>=value&<stop>=value

  This call returns the current values of the given metrics-id (e.g.waerden+cpu-0+cpu-idle)

  <b>metrics-id</b>: collectd id like "waerden+memory+memory-used"

  <b>start</b>: starttime in seconds (unix format) (optional)

  <b>stop</b>: endtime in seconds (unix format) (optional)

  CURL Example: 

  curl -u user http://localhost:4984/metrics/waerden+memory+memory-used.xml

  curl -u user http://localhost:4984/metrics/waerden+memory+memory-used.xml?start=1262701653&stop=1262701953

XmlResult: waerden+memory+memory-used

PUT /graphs/<group-id>

  Set limits of of system states which should not be exceeded or undercut.

  <b>group-id</b>: Graph group id like Memory, CPU, Disk,...

  CURL Example: curl -u user -X PUT -H 'Content-type: text/xml' -d @memory.xml http://localhost:4984/graphs/Memory.xml

XmlBody: memory
  
XmlResult: memory

GET /logs

  Getting the information which logfiles are available. This call does not return the content of a file.

  CURL Example: curl -u user http://localhost:4984/logs.xml

XmlResult: logs

GET /logs/<log-id>?<pos_begin>=value&<lines>=value

  Getting the content of a file.

  <b>log-id</b>: File id. Defined in the description file.

  <b>pos_begin</b>: Line number of the requested text.

  <b>lines</b>: Number of lines which are requested.

  CURL Example: curl -u user http://localhost:4984/logs/system.xml?pos_begin=260;lines=2

XmlResult: system
