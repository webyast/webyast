  defined in /etc/webyast/custom_services.yml.

== Actions


GET /services

  Get the list of all available services, both system (/etc/init.d) and custom (defined in 
  /etc/webyast/custom_services.yml config file) ones.
  
  The result is filtered by the content of the /etc/webyast/filter_services.yml file.
  If filter file is not present or empty, returns everything.
  
  Each service has a name, description and short description (summary). It provides also the
  infomration about dependencies (based on the service definition under /etc/init.d/):
  which other services need to be started or stopped when selected service is started or stopped.
